We now know that there is much more to classical mechanics than previously suspected. The behavior of classical systems is surprisingly rich; derivation of the equations of motion, the focus of traditional presentations of mechanics, is just the beginning. Classical systems display a complicated array of phenomena such as nonlinear resonances, chaotic behavior, and transitions to chaos.\n\nTraditional treatments of mechanics concentrate most of their effort on the extremely small class of symbolically tractable dynamical systems. We concentrate on developing general methods for studying the behavior of systems, whether or not they have a symbolic solution. Typical systems exhibit behavior that is qualitatively different from the solvable systems and surprisingly complicated. We focus on the phenomena of motion, and we make extensive use of computer simulation to explore this motion.","created":"1282876300","others":89,"owner":"maciej","private":"0"},

A predominant approach to collaborative \ufb01ltering is neighborhood based (\u201c -nearest neighbors\u201d), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and\/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called \u201cglobal ef ects\u201d from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy","created":"1282831418","others":48,"owner":"maciej","private":"0"},

Programming languages are not only useful to command computers, they also increas- \ningly are a medium for human communication. I will use the framework of distributed cognition to \ndiscuss how knowledge is shared in a team of programmers and to show that computer code plays \nan important role in it. The resulting model of how programmers comprehend code suggests that \ncommon grounds play an important role in it. I propose two hypotheses concerning the means used \nby programmers to refer to common grounds from within their code. The hypotheses imply that \nmodern languages, such as Scala, o\ufb00er advantages as human communication mediums. I describe an \nexperiment, using an eye-tracking device, that measures the performance of code comprehension. \nThe hypotheses are tested by varying the degree of reference to common grounds.","created":"1251724395","others":83,"owner":"maciej","private":"0"},

The algorithm was invented\/discovered by Stijn van Dongen (that is, me) at the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (also known as CWI) in the Netherlands. The PhD thesis Graph clustering by flow simulation is centered around this algorithm, the main topics being the mathematical theory behind it, its position in cluster analysis and graph clustering, issues concerning scalability, implementation, and benchmarking, and performance criteria for graph clustering in general. The work for this thesis was carried out under supervision of Jan van Eijck and Michiel Hazewinkel. The thesis, technical reports, and preprints can be found in the reading section.","created":"1235149343","others":38,"owner":"maciej","private":"0"},

Graphs are mathematical objects consisting of vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices: think of cities as vertices and interstates as edges connecting two cities. Algorithms might find a shortest path - the fastest route - or a minimal spanning tree or solve one of other interesting problems on graphs: maximal-flow, weighted and non-weighted matching and min-cost flow. Visualisation means linking cause - the statements of an algorithm - immediately to an effect - changes to the graph the algorithm has as its input - by terms of blinking, changing colors and other visual effects.","created":"1226675906","others":15,"owner":"maciej","private":"0"},

We first show how to implement such a view using solely geometric transformations. We then describe a more general transformation that allows hierarchical or structured information about the graph to affect the view. Our general transformation is a fundamental extension to previous research in fisheye views.","created":"1225387126","others":22,"owner":"maciej","private":"0"},
