    # git alias for listing the files in the current directory, along with
    # their hash, author, and a hyperlink to the filename
    #
    # git aliases operate in the root of the git repo by default, so we need to
    # cd into the current directory using GIT_PREFIX
    # https://stackoverflow.com/a/26243454/42559
    #
    # Using :(glob)* gets us the files in the current directory only, instead of
    # listing recursively
    #
    # Here's a version that doesn't use hyperlinks for the file names:
    # ls = ! cd ${GIT_PREFIX:-.} && git ls-files -z ':(glob)*' | xargs -0 -n1 -I{} -- git log -1 --format=\"%<(20,trunc)%aN %<(12)%h%<(24)%ar{}\" {}
    #
    # Here's a version that does use hyperlinks:
    # - use %x1b for literal escape characters
    # - use %x3b for semicolons; otherwise git can't parse this config file
    # - escape backslashes
    # - git's parser turns them into single slashes inside the single quotes
    # - hyperlink format: \e]8;;<url>\e\<link text>\e]8;;\e\ 
    #
    # TODO: link the hash to github maybe?
    ls = ! cd ${GIT_PREFIX:-.} && git ls-files -z ':(glob)*' | xargs -0 -n1 -I{} -- git log -1 --pretty=format:'%<(20,trunc)%aN %<(12)%h%<(24)%ar%x1b]8%x3b%x3bfile:{}%x1b\\{}%x1b]8%x3b%x3b%x1b\\' {}
