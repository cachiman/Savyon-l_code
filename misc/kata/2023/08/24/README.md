- Investigated the Gulf of Maine's rendering in OpenStreetMap
  - it's an incredibly intricate relation currently consisting of [5003 ways](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/13663366)
  - it caused me [this issue](https://github.com/chrieke/prettymapp/issues/26), which I filed as [this issue](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx/issues/1050) in osmnx
  - there's a discussion about areas like this [here](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-mexico-object-rendering-of-large-seas/7466/62), which led to [this proposal](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposal:High_seas) that seems to have gotten... no response at all
    - I desire to rip out the OSM polygon for GoM and replace it with a node, like that person did, but I don't really want to get involved like that
- Did some thinking about how to handle it from osmnx's perspective
  - some thoughts:
    - this polygon is marginally important to what I'm actually trying to get - it is a huge object with a tiny overlap with the area of interest, and we're spending a ton of time calculating a multipolygon the vast majority of which is not relevant to the area of interest
  - what if we just dropped inner areas that were some distance away from our area of interest?
  - what if we automatically simplified relations of >n ways? (1000?)
  - what if we provided the user an option to drop specific objects? large objects?
- I created a debug script that goes straight to \_create_gdf
